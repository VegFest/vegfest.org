How do researchers choose the best approach to measure things like "success"?  We chose to measure it by using an approach that is both explorative, descriptive and explanatory. We asked *exploratory* questions like: What is a veg food fest? When did they start? What is the goal? *Descriptive* questions: Who is involved in organizing veg fests? Where are they held? How are they organized? What is their strategy? What are their challenges? *Explanatory* knowledge will inform the reader: What makes a veg fest a success or a failure? What is common among successful or failing events in terms of organization, structure resources and communications?

The reasoning behind choosing this approach through in-depth interviews was not to gather data that will be representative of every VegFest, rather to learn from individual organizers, in different locations, with a wide range of experience in organizing these events. Rather, we spoke with diverse organizers in order to understand the nuances and variables in organizing, to better support these events more effectively. Measuring success in a quantitative fashion is not a goal of this report. We argue that we are more interested in understanding and observing success, as this is an equally practical approach from the perspective of those in a social movement. We asked our interview participants about success, what it means to them, and what they see as an indication of it. When analyzing the interview data and secondary data sources, we were then able to identify the many facets of "success" and produce a rich analysis of what it means to organizers. What we found is that success is not reducible to attendance or financial health (though these are important factors), a key point that would be difficult to support in the absence of these long conversations with organizers.

In the later section, Analysis, we discuss specific elements that lead to a successful event. These findings should be given special attention, as they are the most practical for organizers and supporters alike. We are proud to offer our audience enhanced knowledge about VegFest organizing, and to open up conversations, create networks, and connect organizers with needed resources for future endeavors. We are interested in making the most out of an existing event model, with suggestions that are aimed at the organization level.

We wish that there was existing compatible research on the attendee level, that addressed impact, diet and lifestyle changes, and the general effectiveness of this model of vegan outreach, that we could incorporate into this report. This research is of course, beyond the scope of this project, however a longitudinal cohort study with VegFest attendees would be a highly recommended future research avenue. We see this as one of the limitations of this project: that one major indicator of success is based on attendees, and the resources and training to conduct research on this population is not only lacking, but significant energy is expended on informal surveys during the event, that produce data which is subject to several validity issues.

## Introduction to Analysis

The following research findings are sourced from an analysis of nine interviews with VegFest organizers. The interview transcripts are available in the appendix, with references to questions found in the interview guide. Direct citations from these transcripts are the structure of our analysis. We chose to often quote our interview participants at length to preserve the context of their insights, as they shared their opinions and experiences with VegFest organizing. Below we will discuss in-depth what organizers shared about the skills needed to make the event a success, their communications and outreach strategies,their internal organization, and financial concerns, and their overall approach and philosophy that inspires them to take this approach to vegan outreach and animal activism.

The names and any identifying information about the interview participants has been changed to protect their privacy.

## Skills and expertise

Adequately skilled organizers and volunteers can plan any large-scale event, VegFests are no exception. Good VegFests are planned by good organizers. It is helpful to think of VegFests as "themed public occasions designed to occur for a limited duration that celebrate valued aspects of a community’s way of life", as suggested by Norman Douglas (2001), when writing about community events. With this in mind, the ‘theme’ and the ‘valued aspects of the communities way of life’ are precisely the factors that make VegFests distinct, and are what complicates the usual skills and expertise involved in successful organizing.

What is the theme of a VegFest? This question is addressed in depth in the section on "philosophy" below, but merits a brief mention here. The theme is distinct from a VegFest's goals or overarching ideology. Instead, a theme is more closely related to the tone and tangible structure of the event. In the case of VegFests, we found the theme to be variably a food festival, a convention, or an edu-tainment event, with an emphasis on fun and inclusion.

Following this, the "valued aspects of the communities way of life" are broad across the vegan/animal-advocacy community, but generally include food, ethical and environmental concerns, social change, and personal health. The skills and expertise that contribute to successful VegFests, therefore, are those that best help "celebrate" their values. "Celebration" is key to the nature of VegFests, and is what makes them the most popular animal advocacy event in North America. Organizers celebrate by working to reach as wide an audience as possible, by ensuring the event is positive and festive, and by affirming the values of the movement to current and future participants. To this end, the skills and expertise that come together to make the event a success are complimentarily practical, personal and cultural.

We examined each interview for mentions of sought-after skills that are or would be an asset to organizers. They included the following:

* Web design skills
* Graphic design skills
* Photography skills
* Video editing skills
* Clerical/bureaucratic, or “paperwork” skills
* Formal event planning specialization
* Fundraising and sponsor recruitment
* Media spokespeople or public relations specialization
* Community outreach and networking skills

VegFest organizers largely apply their own specialized skills to the event, or they call in resources from within their networks as needed. It is notable that when asked, the interview participants did not see any deficit in the above skills as a problem that could be fixed with more funds to hire a professional, rather, they wanted organizers who share their mission to be skilled in this area. This sentiment suggests that although the above skills are desired, there is an *added value* to those who possess these talents and who are part of a vegan/animal advocacy in-group.

>“I mean we could hire somebody to be a festival planner.  And, I had said that I would probably spend time on specific aspects of, like, sponsor recruitment, and volunteer recruitment, and such...then I maybe I would hire somebody to do more of the kind of logistical stuff, and committee coordination, that kind of thing. that would cost a lot of money to **get a competent person that we trust**, and I would love to hire something like that.” (Val Q11.3) (emphasis ours)*
