Between January 2016 and October 2016, two researchers conducted in-depth interviews with over a dozen VegFest organizers across North America. The goal was to determine what key factors in organizing lead to successful veg food festivals. The outcome of this project is threefold: a publicly accessible report with analysis intended for activists and organizers in the vegetarian/vegan and animal movement, a separate private report with recommendations for funders of veg food festivals, and an opportunity for movement building by creating lateral connections among VegFest organizers across the continent.
